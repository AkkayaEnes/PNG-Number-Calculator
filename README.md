# Calculator Project
This project is a Windows Form application created using Microsoft Visual Studio .NET. It can be used as a calculator and the result screen is designed to display at least 10 digits.

# Features
The calculator can be used for addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division operations. However, negative numbers or decimal numbers are not supported. The project includes custom digit images for the result screen.

# Usage
The calculator is very easy to use. Simply enter the two numbers you want to perform the operation on, and then select the operation you want to perform. The result will be displayed on the result screen. Make sure that the numbers are positive integers before performing any operations, as negative or decimal numbers are not supported.
